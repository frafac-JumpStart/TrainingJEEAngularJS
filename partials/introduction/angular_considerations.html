			<em>AngularJs</em> is designed for SPA, so it is not really 
			compliant with Portlet based architecture (even if it is not 
			impossible, it is not recommended)
		</li>
		<li>
			To make an AngularJs application, a good 
			javascript knowledge is mandatory
		</li>
		<li>
			AngularJS 1.3 is dropping support for IE8.
			With Such a JavaScript Framework you can add code that doesnâ€™t work with IE9 or IE10. 
			IE on the whole could make around 25% of your traffic. 
			So before using AngularJS you have to check with your client if he add any accessibility constraints 
			and to strictly define the list of supported browser.  
		</li>
		<li>
			According to the Google Team, the next version (2.0) 
			of AngularJS will introduce many breaking changes. 
			So any new project which will start with the current 
			release (1.3),  may have to be completely rewrote in 
			about 6 Months
		</li>
		<li>
			Keep in mind that best practices about topics like 
			Authentication ,  XSS &amp; CRSF must be defined at 
			the beginning of your project if you want to be 
			consistent with OWASP and PCI
